Starting in the fall of 2021, I will be a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley. My research interests broadly include both theoretical and applied aspects of machine learning. In the past, I have worked extensively with sequencing and population data.    
  
During my undergrad at Texas A&M, I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Boris Hanin](https://hanin.princeton.edu/). I spent the summer of 2020 in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Dr. Briana Stephenson](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/briana-stephenson/). In the fall of 2020, I worked with [Dr. Huiyan Sang](https://web.stat.tamu.edu/~huiyan/) to provide statistical expertise in a [COVID-19 task force](https://temag.tamu.edu/) concerned with students returning to campus. My collaboration with [Dr. Shuying Sun](https://www.math.txstate.edu/about/people/faculty/sun.html) recently resulted in my [first publication](https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-021-07990-7). Our work is the first-ever investigation of hemimethylation in lung cancer.
